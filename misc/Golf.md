General mechanics
-----------------

- Keep hands up high and arms straight when addressing the ball, don't drop them low. When you swing, your arms will be mostly straight due to momentum, so you want to address the ball in a similar stance.
- Keep club path low (right elbow touching side); don't bring arms wide out away from the body
- Keep weight shifting properly; right leg should break inward as weight shifts, not stay straight
- Finish the swing; don't stop arms early, follow through

Specific shots
--------------

### Drives and long fairway shots

- For longer clubs (driver, 3 iron, etc), set the ball further toward the front foot

### Chipping

- Use primarily 8, 9, P clubs
- Sand wedge hits way higher than you'd expect
- Weight forward, ball back
- Consider opening the clubface and aiming to the left of the target (you will naturally push the ball to the right of where your body would normally aim)
- To hit high, give some wrist action to scoop w/ hands

### Putting

- Use shoulders instead of just arms.
- Don't necessarily have to keep arms totally straight.
- Make sure to do a significant follow-through after hitting the ball.
