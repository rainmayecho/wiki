UI design
=========

Design process
--------------

- Draw wireframe
- Implement wireframe
- Typography w/ lorem ipsum
- Grayscale
- Content/images
- Color
- Shoot for 45 to 75 characters/line


Whitespace
----------

- If you want to make UI that looks designed, you need to add in a lot of breathing room. Sometimes a ridiculous amount. Start by doubling, and going down from there.
- Same for font sizes, element sizes, etc. Try blowing them up huge to see how they respond.


Text overlay
------------

- Overlay the whole image with translucent black
- Text with a background
- Overlay the image w/ a dimmed and blurred text box
- Floor fade: subtly fade bottom of image to black


Typography
----------

### General guidelines

- Use em1.5 line height for small text, 1.1 for large text.
- Use 1em between paragraphs.
- Use serif for print, sans for monitor.
- Use \#444 instead of black.


### Make text pop and un-pop

- Font size (bigger or smaller)
- Color (greater contrast or lesser; bright colors draw the eye)
- Font weight (bolder or thinner)
- Capitalization (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case)
- Italicization
- Letter spacing
- Margins
- Maybe a bad idea:
    - Underline. Underline means links nowadays.
    - Text background color
    - Strikethrough
