[Intro]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x4


[Verse 1]

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

Em                 D
I want a ticket to anywhere.

Cmaj7           G
Maybe we make a deal,

Em                    D
Maybe together we can get somewhere.

Cmaj7        G
Any place is better.

Em                      D
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.

Cmaj7            G
Maybe we'll make something,

Em               D
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Verse 2]

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

Em              D
I got a plan to get us out of here:

Cmaj7                 G
I been working at the convenience store,

Em                     D
Managed to save just a little bit of money.

Cmaj7                   G
Won't have to drive too far

Em                         D
Just 'cross the border and into the city, 

Cmaj7         G
You and I can both get jobs

    Em                  D
And finally see what it means to be living.

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Verse 3]

         Cmaj7              G
You see, my old man's got a problem:

   Em                               D
He live with the bottle, that’s the way it is.

   Cmaj7                       G
He says his body's too old for working,

    Em                  D
His body's too young to look like his.

   Cmaj7             G             Em                         D
My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,

         Cmaj7                  G
I said, "Somebody's got to take care of him."

   Em                       D
So I quit school and that's what I did.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Verse 4]

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

          Em                    D
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Cmaj7             G
We gotta make a decision:

Em                        D
Leave tonight or live and die this way.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D X2


[Chorus]

                            C                G
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,

    C                         G
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,

Em              C
City lights lay out before us

         Em                     D
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 

    C Em      D  
And I   had a feeling that I belonged

    C Em      D                  Em          C           Em
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Verse 5]

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

    Em                     D
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;

Cmaj7                 G
you still ain't got a job

      Em                    D
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.

Cmaj7                  G
I know things will get better:

Em                   D
You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 

Cmaj7                 G
We'll move out of the shelter

Em                     D
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Chorus]

                             C                G
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,

    C                         G
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,

Em              C
City lights lay out before us

         Em                     D
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 

    C Em      D  
And I   had a feeling that I belonged

    C Em      D                  Em          C           Em
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.


[Instrumental]

[Verse 6]

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

    Em               D
And I got a job that pays all our bills.

Cmaj7                 G
You stay out drinking late at the bar,

        Em                         D
You see more your friends than you do your kids.

Cmaj7                G
I'd always hoped for better,

Em                     D
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,

Cmaj7                  G
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,

   Em                     D
so take your fast car and keep on driving.


[Instrumental]

Cmaj7 G  Em D x2


[Chorus]

                            C                G
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,

    C                         G
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,

Em              C
City lights lay out before us

         Em                     D
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 

    C Em      D  
And I   had a feeling that I belonged

    C Em      D                  Em          C           Em
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.

[Verse 7]


Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.

          Em                    D
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Cmaj7             G
We gotta make a decision:

Em                        D
