Capo on 3


[Verse]

G        D                 Am          Am
Drove downtown in the rain, nine-thirty on a Tuesday...
G               D                     Bm        Am
night, Just to check out the late-night record shop.
G        D                    Am               Am
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane;
G                D                   Bm    Am
But when I'm surrounded I just can't Sto-o-op.


[Verse]

G                 D                            Am                     Am
It's a matter of instinct. it's a matter of conditioning, a matter of fact.
G        D             Bm   Am
You can call me Pavlov's do-og,
G       D                 Am                  Am
Ring a bell and I'll salivate, how'd you like that?
G     D                  Bm               Am
Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue 'cause right now I'm...


[Chorus]

    G         D              Am          Am
I'm lying in bed, just like Brian Wilson did
           G       D                    Em   (walk-up x2)
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did...

[Verse]

G       D     Am           Am
So I'm lying here, just staring at the ceiling...
G                D            Bm                Am
tiles, And I'm thinking about oh what to think about.
G     D                 Am
Just listening and re-listening to Smiley...
G                 D                 Bm             Am
Smile, and I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought because


[Chorus]

    G         D              Am          Am
I'm lying in bed, just like Brian Wilson did
           G       D                    Em   (walk-up x2)
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did...


[Bridge 1]

Am                  D                F            Em
And if you want to find me, I'll be out in the sandbox
Am          D                     G       F     (Am)
Wondering where the hell all the love has go-o-one.
Am           D                   F            Em
Playing my guitar and building castles in the sun whoa-oh...
Am        D                 G
Oh, and singing "Fun, Fun, Fun"


[Chorus]

G         D             Am          Am
Lying in bed, just like Brian Wilson did
           G       D                    Em   (walk-up x2)
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did...


[Bridge 2]

Am    E7    Am               E7            Am
... I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
    E7                Am       E7                              Am
And though I was very heavy, I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
  E7             Am               E7
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground, whoa
Am                E7
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am                E7
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am                E7
Somebody help meeeeee, because I'm...


[Chorus]

G         D              Am          Am
Lying in bed, just like Brian Wilson did
           G       D                    Em   (walk-up x2)
Well I'm lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did...


[Verse]

G        D                 Am          Am
Drove downtown in the rain, nine-thirty on a Tuesday...
G               D                     Bm        Am
night, Just to check out the late-night record shop.
G        D                    Am               Am
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane;
G                D                   Bm    Em (walk-up)
But when I'm surrounded I just can't Sto-o-op.
