[Verse]

   A                      C
My child arrived just the other day;
   D                          A
he came into the world in the usual way.
               A                    C
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
D                            A
  He learned to walk while I was away.
           G               G/F#          Em7         Em/D
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it.  And as he grew
           C         Em/B    A              C              Em/B    A
he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad.  You know I'm gonna be like you."


[Chorus]

        A                           G
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
C                       D
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
 A                              G
"When you comin' home Dad?"  "I don't know when,
    C           Em/B       A           C                 Em/B      A
but we'll get together then, Son.  You know we'll have a good time then."

[Verse]

   A                       C
My son turned ten just the other day.
          D                               A
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad.  Come on, let's play.
        A                             C
Can you teach me to throw?"  I said, "Not today.
        D                        A
I got a   lot to do."  He said, "That's okay."
       G         G/F#         Em7         Em/D
And he   walked away, but his smile never dimmed.
          C         Em/B    A               C              Em/B    A
It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  You know I'm gonna be like him."


[Chorus]

        A                           G
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
C                       D
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
 A                              G
"When you comin' home Dad?"  "I don't know when,
    C           Em/B       A           C                 Em/B      A
but we'll get together then, Son.  You know we'll have a good time then."

[Verse]

         A                               C
Well, he came home from college just the other day,
   D                      A
so much like a man I just had to say,
          A                      C
"Son, I'm proud of you.  Can you sit for a while?"
   D                     A
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
          G            G/F#       Em7          Em/D
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.
C         Em/B          A
  See you later.  Can I have them please?"


[Chorus]

        A                           G
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
C                       D
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
 A                              G
"When you comin' home Son?"  "I don't know when,
    C           Em/B       A           C                 Em/B      A
but we'll get together then, Dad.  You know we'll have a good time then."

[Verse] (Slower)

     A                      C
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.
D                          A
  I called him up just the other day.
             A                  C
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
              D                        A
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.
            G           G/F#           Em7            Em/D
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
         C         Em/B       A                    C         Em/B       A
but it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  It's been sure nice talkin' to you."
         G           G/F#     Em7         Em/D
And as I hung up the phone it occured to me,
     C        Em/B      A(no 3rd) C       Em/B      A
he'd grown up just like me.    My boy was just like me.


[Chorus] (Faster again)

        A                           G
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
C                       D
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
 A                              G
"When you comin' home Son?"  "I don't know when,
    C           Em/B       A            C            Em/B      A
but we'll get together then, Dad, we're gonna have a good time then."
