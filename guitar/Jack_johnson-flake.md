[Intro]

Dm  F  Bb  F
Dm  F  Bb  F


[Verse]

Dm                     F
 I know she said it's alright
Bb                               F
   But you can make it up next time
Dm                       F
I know she knows it's not right
Bb                          F
   There ain't no use in lying
Dm                      F
Maybe she thinks I know something
       Bb                           F
Maybe maybe she thinks its fine
Dm                   F
Maybe she knows something I don't
       Bb            C
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying


[Chorus]

F                       C
  It seems to me that maybe
Dm                        A
  It pretty much always means no
   Bb                  C                   F            C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
F                        C
  And often times we're lazy
Dm                      A
   It seems to stand in my way
    Bb               C
Cause no one no not no one
                     F             C
Likes to be let down


[Verse] (there are rhythm changes in this verse)

Dm (hold)               F (hold)
I know she loves the sunrise
Bb (hold)                         F (hold)
   No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
    Dm (hold)                         F(hold)
And I know that when she said she's gonna try
Bb (hold)                           F (hold)
Well it might not work because of other ties and
Dm                            F
I know she usually has some other ties
    Bb                               F
And I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em
Dm                       F
   Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Bb              C
Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie too


[Chorus]

F                       C
  It seems to me that maybe
Dm                        A
  It pretty much always means no
   Bb                  C                   F            C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
F                        C
  And often times we're lazy
Dm                      A
   It seems to stand in my way
    Bb               C
Cause no one no not no one
                     F             C
Likes to be let down

F                       C
  It seems to me that maybe
Dm                        A
  It pretty much always means no
   Bb                  C                   F            C
So don't tell me you might just let it go
F                        C
  And often times we're lazy
Dm                      A
   It seems to stand in my way
    Bb               C
Cause no one no not no one
                     F             C
Likes to be let down
