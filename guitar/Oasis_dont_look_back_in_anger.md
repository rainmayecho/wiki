================================

```
[Intro]

C  F  C  F



[Verse 1]

C               G            Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind

          E              F    G
Don't you know you might find

                  C      Am G
A better place to play

C             G           Am
You said that you'd never been

            E                  F    G
But all the things that you've seen

             C    Am G F
Slowly fade away



[Pre-Chorus]

F                Fm             C
So I start a revolution from my bed

         F                 Fm             C
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

F                 Fm              C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

G
Stand up beside the fireplace

    E
And take that look from off your face

Am             G             F         G
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out



[Chorus]

C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

         G          C   Am G
as we're walking on by

    C    G       Am   E
Her soul slides away,

               F             G
but don't look back in anger

            C   G   Am   E   F   G   C   Am G
I heard you say



[Verse 2]

C              G               Am
Take me to the place where you go

      E      F      G                C    Am G
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day

C                     G           Am
Please don't put your life in the hands

     E             F     G                    C    Am G
of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away



[Pre-Chorus]

F                     Fm             C
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

         F                 Fm             C
'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

F                 Fm              C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

G
Stand up beside the fireplace

E
Take that look from off your face

     Am             G             F         G
'Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out



[Chorus]

C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

         G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by

   C    G       Am   E
My soul slides away,

               F             G
but don't look back in anger

            C   Am G
I heard you say


(Solo)


[Chorus]

C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

         G          C   Am G
as we're walking on by

    C    G       Am   E
Her soul slides away,

               F             G
but don't look back in anger

            C    Am G
I heard you say

C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

         G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by

   C    G       Am
My soul slides away

               F
But don't look back in anger

           Fm
Don't look back in anger

            C   G   Am   E   F   Fm               C
I heard you say                    At least not today
