Gm                         Cm   Dm
                     Girl,

Gm
Tonight we're gonna make love

        Gm
You know how I know?     Beacuse it's Wednesday,

                                   Gm               Cm   Dm
And Wednesday night is night that we usually make love.




        Gm
Monday night is my night to cook

                Gm
Tuesday night we go and visit your mother,

            Gm                                      Cm   Dm
But Wednesday we make, sweet weekly love.

Gm
     That's when everything is just right
Gm
     There's nothing good on TV
Gm
     You haven't had your after-work social sports team practice



Gm
     So you are not too tired

Gm
     Oh, boy, it's all on

Gm
     You lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear like,

                                 Gm
"I might go to bed now. I have work in the morning."

Gm
     I know what you're trying to say, girl

                      Cm      Cm  Dm        Gm
You're trying to say, "Oh yeah,        It's business time,

    Gm             G
It's business time."


[Chorus]

Cm
     It's business,

Dm                        Gm
     It's business time.     I know what you're trying to say.

                  Gm
You're trying to say it's time for business. It's business time, ooh

Cm
     It's business,

Dm                     Gm        Gm6
     It's business time.



[Verse]

Gm
     Then we're in the bathroom brushing our teeth 

      Gm                                           Cm   Dm   Gm
That's all part of the foreplay, I love foreplay

Gm
     Then you sort out the recycling 

      Gm
That isn't part of the foreplay process, but it is still very important

Gm
     Next thing you know, we're in the bedroom.

       Gm
You're wearing that baggy old ugly T-Shirt

    Gm
you got from your work several years ago

Gm
     Mm, you know the one, baby, with the color stain.



Gm
     I remove my clothes very, very clumsily,

Gm
     Tripping sensuously over my pants

Gm
Now I'm naked except for my socks

                                 Gm
And you know when I'm down to my socks    what time it is.



[Chorus]

Cm
     It's business,

Dm                        Gm
     It's business time,     You know when I'm down to my sock,

              Gm
It's time for business. That's why they're called business socks, ooh

Cm
     It's business, 

Dm                      Gm      Gm6
     It's business time.

[Verse]

Gm                         Gm
     Making love,          Making love for

Gm                         Gm
     Making love for two,  Making love for two minutes

Gm
     When it's with me girl, you only need two minutes,

            Gm
Because I'm so intense



     Gm
You whisper something sexy like: "Is that it?",

Gm
     I know what you're trying to say, girl

Gm
     You're trying to say, "Oh yeah, that's it"

Gm
     And then you tell me you want some more.

      Gm
Well, uh, I'm not surprise       but I'm quite sleepy.


[Chorus]

Cm
     It's business,

Dm                     Gm
     It's business time.

                       Gm
Business hours are over, baby



Cm
     It's business,

Dm                     Gm      Gm6      Cm       Dm
     It's business.

Gm                             Cm       Dm       Gm
