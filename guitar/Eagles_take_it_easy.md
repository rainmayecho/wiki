[Intro]

G Am7/G D7sus4/G x2



[Verse]

           G
Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load

                     D     C
I've got seven women on my mind

G                       D
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me

C                              G
One says she's a friend of mine



[Chorus]

         Em            C G
Take it easy, take it easy

              Am                C                 Em
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy

         C                 G
Lighten up while you still can

           C             G
Don't even try to understand

            Am                  C                   G
Just find a place to make your stand,  and take it easy



[Verse]

             G
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona

            D        C
Such a fine sight to see

       G                 D
It's a girl my lord in a flat-bed Ford

        C                       G
Slowin' down to take a look at me

         Em D             C  G
Come on, ba-by, don't say maybe

        Am                 C              Em
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

       C               G                  C             G
We may lose and we may win, though we may never be here again

        Am              C              G
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy
