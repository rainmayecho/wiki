[Intro]

Em  G  D  A  x4


[Verse]

Em         G
Today is gonna be the day
              D                     A
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em           G
By now you should've somehow
    D                  A
Realized what you gotta do


Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A
Feels the way I do
          C    D   A   A
About you now


Em           G
Backbeat the word was on the street
         D                    A
That the fire in your heart is out
Em              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
        D                  A
But you never really had a doubt
Em                    G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A
Feels the way I do
          Em    G   D   A
About you now


[Pre-chorus]

    C                D                     Em     Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    C                   D                 Em      Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
C             D
There are many things that I would
G       D/F#   Em
Like to say to you
     D           A   A   A
but I don't know how


[Chorus]

        C     Em    G
Because maybe
Em                           C          Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
    Em    C    Em
And after all
G         Em    C    Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall


[Verse 2]

Em         G
Today is gonna be the day
              D                     A
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em           G
By now you should've somehow
    D                  A
Realized what you gotta do


Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A
Feels the way I do
          C     D   A   A
About you now


[Pre-chorus]

    C                D                     Em     Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    C                   D                 Em      Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
C             D
There are many things that I would
G       D/F#   Em
Like to say to you
      D          A   A   A
but I don't know how


[Chorus]

        C     Em    G

Em                           C          Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
    Em    C    Em
And after all
G         Em    C    Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall


[Outro]

       C     Em    G
I said maybe
Em                           C          Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Em                           C          Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Em                           C          Em   G   Em
You're gonna be the one that saves me
