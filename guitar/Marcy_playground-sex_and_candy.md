[Verse (bar)]

 B             G             F#
Hangin' round downtown by myself
           B                        G           F#
and I had so much time to sit and think about myself
                    B
and then there she was
      G             F#
like double cherry pie
                B
yeah there she was
      G          F#
like disco super-fly


[Chorus (non-bar G and A)]

    riff        B  G     A
I smell sex and candy here
                   B   G      A
Who's that loungin' in my chair?
                  B          G             A
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
                        D   A   B
Mama this surely is a dream

 B             G             F#
Hanging round downtown by myself
           B                        G           F#
and I've had too much caffeine and I was thinkin bout myself
                    B
and then there she was
      G             F#
in platform double suede
                B
yeah there she was
      G          F#
like disco lemonade


[Chorus]

                  B          G             A
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
