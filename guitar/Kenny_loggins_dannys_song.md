Kenny Loggins - Danny's Song
===========================

```
[Verse]

D                 C              Bm                    E7
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one, and we've just begun,

                 A
Think I'm gonna have a son.

D              C                Bm                  E7
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove, conceived in love,

               A
Sun is gonna shine above.


[Chorus]

G                   A               D             Bm
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,

    G                A                D      Bm
And everything will bring a chain of love.

G                   A          D                       C
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,

    Bm      E7    A
And tell me everything is gonna be allright.


[Verse]

D                   C         Bm          E7
Seems as though a month ago I was beta chi, never got high,

               A
Oh, I was a sorry guy.

D                    C                   Bm
And now a smile, a face, a girl that shares my name,

          E7                                        A
Now I'm through with the game, this boy will never be the same.


[Chorus]

G                   A               D             Bm
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,

    G                A                D      Bm
And everything will bring a chain of love.

G                   A          D                       C
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,

    Bm      E7    A
And tell me everything is gonna be all right.



D                C         Bm               E7
Pisces, virgo rising is a very good sign, strong and kind,

                A
And the little boy is mine.

D            C                 Bm                         E7
Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun,

                    A
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.


[Chorus]

G                   A               D             Bm
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,

    G                A                D      Bm
And everything will bring a chain of love.

G                   A          D                       C
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,

    Bm      E7    A
And tell me everything is gonna be allright.


D                     C                Bm          E7
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup, drink it up,

                      A
Love her and she'll bring you luck.

    D                C                         Bm
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy, take her home,

           E7                             A
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.
