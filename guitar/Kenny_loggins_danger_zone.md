Kenny Loggins - Danny's Song
===========================

Capo on 6

```
[Intro] Am

Am
Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go

G              Am
Highway to the Danger Zone
G             Am
Ride into the Danger Zone

Am
Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive

G              Am
Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you
F       G      F
Right into the Danger Zone

           D
They never say hello to you
                        C
Until you get it on the red line overload
             F
You'll never know what you can do
                       G
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Am
Out along the edge
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

G              Am
Highway to the Danger Zone
I'm gonna take you
G              Am
Right into the Danger Zone
F              D
Highway to the Danger Zone
G              Am
Right into the Danger Zone
```
