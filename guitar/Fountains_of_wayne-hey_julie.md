==============================


```
[Intro]

G C G D G C G D


[Verse]

G           C         G           D
Working all day for a mean little man
       G       C         G      D
With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan
            Em                 C             D            G
He's got me running 'round the office like a dog around a track
    Em              C                   D               G
But when I get back home, you're always there to rub my back


[Chorus]

G   C
Hey Julie,
D                 C
Look what they're doing to me
Em                C
Trying to trip me up
          D       G
Trying to wear me down
G        C           D          C
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
        Em            C           D       G
And I'd never make it through without you around
        Em            C           D       G
No I'd never make it through without you around


[Verse]

G            C            G         D
Hours on the phone making pointless calls
        G            C                 G          D
I got a desk full of papers that means nothing at all
    Em              C    D            G
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Em                C           D          G
Counting down the hours 'til I get to see your face


[Chorus]

G   C
Hey Julie,
D                 C
Look what they're doing to me
Em                C
Trying to trip me up
          D       G
Trying to wear me down
G        C              D       C
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
        Em            C            D        G
And I'd never make it through with out you around
        Em            C            D        G
No, I'd never make it through with out you around


[Bridge]

Em                 Bm
How did it come to be
                    C
That you and I must be
                   D
Far away from each other every day?
Em                  Bm
Why must I spend my time
              C
Filling up my mind
                            D
With facts and figures that never add up anyway?
     C
They never add up anyway


[Verse]

G           C         G           D
Working all day for a mean little guy
       G      C         G            D
With a bad toupee and a soup-stained tie
            Em                 C
He's got me running 'round the office
       D           G
Like a gerbil on a wheel
       Em              C
He can tell me what to do
             D               G
But he can't tell me what to feel


[Chorus]

G   C
Hey Julie,
D                 C
Look what they're doing to me
Em                C
Trying to trip me up
          D       G
Trying to wear me down
G        C           D          C
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
        Em            C           D       G
And I'd never make it through without you around
        Em            C           D       G
No I'd never make it through without you around
        Em            C           D       G
No I'd never make it through without you around
