Black beans and rice
====================

Ingredients
-----------

Beans:

- 1 lb. (2 cups) dry black beans, picked over to remove broken or wrinkled beans or small stones
- 6 cups water
- 1 small onion, halved (not diced)
- 2-3 whole garlic cloves
- 1 tsp dry oregano
- 1 bay leaf

Add last:

- Cumin and chili powder to taste
- Small bit of acid (vinegar or ~1 lime)
- 2tsp salt

Rice:

- Cooked white rice
- Lime
- Cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Place the beans in a big bowl, cover with water, agitate the beans a few times to remove any dirt, drain in a colander and rinse again.
2. Place black beans, onion, garlic cloves, and bay leaf in a slow cooker. Add water.
3. Cook on high for about 3-4 hours, testing after 3 hours. To test doneness, spoon out a few beans and blow on them. If the skins peel back, they beans are ready. Taste just to make sure. If all of the water has been absorbed, add more. Beans must stay completely covered to prevent them from burning. If cooking on low for 6-8 hours, test the beans at the 6 hour point.
4. Add the salt and let cook, or sit with heat off for another 20-30 minutes, to absorb the salt. Remove the bay leaf, garlic cloves, and onion before using, if desired.
5. If a lot of water remains, drain some. To thicken, blend some of the beans w/ immersion blender to desired consistency. Season w/ cumin or chili powder.
