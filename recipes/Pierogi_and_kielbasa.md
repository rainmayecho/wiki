Pierogi and kielbasa
====================

Ingredients
-----------

- Sauerkraut Filling:
    - 2 tablespoons butter
    - 1/3 cup chopped onion
    - 1 1/2 cups sauerkraut, drained and minced
    - salt and pepper to taste
- Potato Filling:
    - 3 tablespoons butter
    - 1/2 cup chopped onion
    - 2 cups cold mashed potatoes
    - 1 teaspoon salt
    - 1 teaspoon white pepper
- Dough:
    - 3 egg
    - 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
    - 3 cups all-purpose flour
    - 1/4 teaspoon salt
    - 1 tablespoon baking powder

Directions
----------

1. Make mashed potatoes
2. Sautee onion for sauerkraut and potato filling
3. Combine about half of the onions with the mashed potatoes
4. Sautee the rest of the onions with the sauerkraut for about 5 more minutes.
5. To make the dough, beat together the eggs and sour cream until smooth. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; stir into the sour cream mixture until dough comes together. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth. Divide the dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8 inch thickness (measure this; it should be very thin!). Cut into 3 inch rounds using a biscuit cutter.
6. Place a small spoonful of the mashed potato filling into the center of each round. Moisten the edges with water, fold over, and press together with a fork to seal. Repeat procedure with the remaining dough and the sauerkraut filling.
7. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add perogies and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until pierogi float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon.
