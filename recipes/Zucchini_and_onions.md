Zucchini and onions
===================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 zucchini, sliced into strips
- 3 large yellow onion cut into half-rings (will cook way down)
- 2 tbsp Soy sauce
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 2 cloves minced garlic or garlic powder

Directions
----------

1. Melt butter in pan
2. Saute onions. Cook at least 10-15 minutes on high, reducing to medium and cooking for ~35 minutes if caramelized onions are desired. Stir only occasionally to allow browning to occur. Add garlic with about 5 minutes remaining.
3. Briefly deglaze with soy sauce, cook for a few more minutes until tender.
4. Repeat for zucchini, but for a much shorter time (5 minutes, just until tender)
