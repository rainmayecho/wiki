St. Germain Shandy
===================

Ingredients
-----------

- 5 parts Pilsner Beer
- 1.5 parts St-Germain
- 2 Lemon Wedges

Directions
----------

- For a Shandy that the royal court may have imbibed publicly, stir ingredients together in a pint glass filled halfway to the top with ice. Squeeze two wedges (or half a lemon) and submerge into glass. One may want to kick off oneâ€™s shoes at this point.
