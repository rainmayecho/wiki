French Gimlet
=============

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 parts Gin or Vodka
- 1 part St-Germain
- 1/2 part Freshly Squeezed Lime Juice


Directions
----------

- Method: Raymond Chandler described the perfect Gimlet in one of his novels. Sadly, he would not live to taste a French one. Pour all ingredients into an ice-ﬁlled shaker and, well, shake. Shake well. Strain into a coupe or martini cocktail glass, and add a “spot of lime.” For Raymond.
