=================

Ingredients
-----------

- large green plantain, peeled and sliced lengthwise and in half (4 pieces)
- oil (for deep frying)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 cup thinly sliced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
- 1⁄4 teaspoon cumin
- 1 -2 pinch cayenne or 1 -2 pinch dried chipotle powder, to taste
- 6 ounces shaved shoulder steak (or other tender cut such as flank, or thinly sliced chicken breast meat)
- salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 4 slices American cheese
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- romaine lettuce
- thinly sliced tomatoes or roasted red pepper
- 1 teaspoon melted butter
- 1⁄4 teaspoon roasted minced garlic

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil, then fry the peeled and sliced plantain for 1 minute.
2. Remove plantain from oil, place on a heavy cutting board (if wooden, wrap board in plastic first, which will assist in the spreading of the softened plantain), top with another cutting board, and flatten the plantain between them.
3. Fry the now-flattened plantain in the oil again, until outside is golden and crispy; remove from oil, set aside on paper towels to blot oil, and keep warm.
4. Over medium high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil together, then sauté the onions until just becoming soft.
5. Add the garlic, cumin, and cayenne (to taste), stir well, then add the meat slices and sauté until browned; season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Spread mayonnaise on bottom slice of flattened fried plantain, lay down 2 slices of American cheese, then the meat and onions. Top with lettuce and thinly sliced tomato (or roasted red pepper), then the remaining plantain top.
7. Combine 1 teaspoon melted butter with 1/4 teaspoon roasted minced garlic, then brush the top plantain slice with the butter garlic mixture.
8. Repeat steps to make another sandwich.
