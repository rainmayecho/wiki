Cauliflower cheese
==================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 medium head (about 2 to 2 1/4 pounds) cauliflower
- 4 tablespoons (55 grams or 2 ounces) unsalted butter
- 4 tablespoons (30 grams or 1 ounce) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons mustard powder
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper or ground cayenne
- 2 cups (475 ml) milk, whole is best but low-fat will probably work just fine
- 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (about 155 grams or 5 1/2 ounces total) grated cheddar, the strongest you can get, \*preferably English or Irish
- Chopped chives or flat-leaf parsley, for garnish (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Trim cauliflower and remove tough core. Cut into 1 to 2-inch florets. Steam (for about 10 minutes) or par-boil (6 to 7 minutes) florets until firm but tender. Drain, if needed, and spread florets on a towel so that it can wick out as much moisture as possible
3. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add flour and whisk to combine; cook for 1 minute to ensure you get rid of the floury taste. Add mustard powder and a pinch of cayenne or few grinds of black pepper, and stir to combine. Drizzle in milk in a thin, steady stream, whisking the whole time so that no lumps form. Season with salt and bring mixture to a simmer, stirring with a spoon; mixture should thicken. Stir in 1 1/4 cups cheddar, a handful at a time, letting each handful melt before adding the next. Taste sauce and adjust seasonings if needed.
4. Spread cauliflower florets in a 2-quart baking ovenproof baking dish. Spoon sauce over florets and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cheese. Bake until until bronzed and bubbly, about 30 minutes. For reference, f I wasn’t in such a rush to get dinner out on the table, I’d have baked mine a minute or two longer, up to 35 minutes.
5. Sprinkle with herbs, if desired. Eat with abandon.
