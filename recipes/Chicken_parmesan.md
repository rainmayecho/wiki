Chicken parmesan
================

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
- 1 3/4 cups buttermilk, divided
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 loaf crusty italian bread, crust removed, sliced into 1/2-inch slices
- 5 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil
- 1 quart Italian-American red sauce (see note above)
- 10 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, basil, or a mix

Directions
----------

1. Either pound flat or split chicken breasts to thin width (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
2. Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and minced garlic to bowl w/ chicken. Season with 2 tablespoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Leave bread out on counter for at least 4 hours and up to overnight until mostly dried.
3. The next day, break bread into rough pieces (leave the wire rack in the rimmed baking sheet) and combine with 4 ounces Parmesan cheese in the food processor. Season with black pepper. Process until bread is finely ground, about 20 seconds. Place in shallow bowl or plate. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk over the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture and incorporate with your fingertips. The mixture should be mealy, but hold together in clumps if you squeeze it together with your hands.
4. Place flour in a shallow bowl or pie plate.
5. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third pie plate.
6. Chicken -> flour -> eggs -> breadcrumbs.
7. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
8. Fry chicken @ around 375 about 2 minutes per side, drain on paper towel.
9. Spoon 1/3 of sauce onto the bottom of a casserole or oven-safe serving dish. Shingle chicken pieces on top of sauce. Top with more sauce. Combine mozzarella and remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese in a large bowl and toss to coat. Lay cheese mixture over chicken.
10. Transfer to the oven and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately grate fresh Parmesan on top. Allow to rest for 3 minutes, top with chopped herbs, and serve immediately.
