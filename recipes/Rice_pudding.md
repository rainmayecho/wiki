Rice pudding
============

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup long-grain white rice
- 2 cinnamon sticks (I had very large canela sticks — see bottom for more info — so I only used one)
- 2 strips of lemon or orange zest (can use a peeler to get a larger piece)
- 3 whole cloves or a tiny pinch of ground cloves
- 4 cups water
- 1 egg
- 3 cups whole milk (updated to note that many people, including my mother, successfully made this with lower fat milks)
- 1 (12-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (I realized after the fact that my can had been 14 ounces, had no averse effect)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon vanilla

Directions
----------

1. Soak the rice, cinnamon sticks, lemon or orange zest and whole or powdered cloves in the water in a heavy saucepan for 1 hour.
2. After soaking, bring the rice mixture to a boil on high heat, uncovered. When it starts to boil (about 5 minutes), lower the heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 more minutes or until water is almost evaporated.
3. While rice is cooking, beat the egg in a bowl. Add the milk and stir well to mix. Add the egg mixture, condensed milk, salt, and vanilla extract to the rice and cook over medium-low heat, stirring carefully, until it thickens slightly or until desired consistency about 25 to 35 minutes (see notes that follow).
4. Remove citrus zest and cinnamon sticks. Let cool uncovered, then chill the rest of the way in the fridge.
