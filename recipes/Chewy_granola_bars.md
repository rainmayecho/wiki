Chewy granola bars
==================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup oat flour\* (or 1 cup oats finely ground in food processor or blender)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup unpacked brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups quick oats\*
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°; line a 9 x 9 baking pan with 2 long pieces of parchment paper, long enough to go up over the sides for easy removal. Lightly spray with oil.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.
3. In a large bowl, with a mixer cream together the butter and the sugar on medium speed.
4. Add the egg followed by the honey, applesauce and vanilla extract.
5. Working by hand, stir in the flour mixture and the oats until just combined and no streaks of flour remain; stir in the chocolate chips, raisins and nuts.
6. Spoon oats onto prepared baking dish, flattening to make even. Bake for about 23-25 minutes, or until light brown at the edges. They will seem soft and undercooked, but once they cool they will set completely.
7. Cool completely on a wire rack then refrigerate before cutting. This will help them hold together better. To cut use a long serrated bread knife and cut in a sawing motion.
8. Try them with cranberries instead of raisins, you can replace the chocolate chips with mini m and m's, leave the nuts out, add coconut, whatever you like!!
