Grilled chicken with spinach and melted mozzarella
==================================================

Ingredients
-----------

- 24oz (3 large) chicken breasts sliced in half lengthwise to make 6 cutlets
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 t olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 10oz frozen spinach, drained
- 3oz shredded part skim mozzarella
- 1 roasted red pepper, sliced in strips

Directions
----------

1. Preheat oven to 400°. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Lightly spray a grill with oil (I used my George Forman) or grill outside on a gas grill. Cook chicken on the grill until no longer pink, careful not to overcook or you'll have dry chicken.
2. Meanwhile, heat a sauté pan on medium heat. Add oil and garlic, sauté a few seconds, add spinach, salt and pepper. Cook a few minutes until heated through.
3. When chicken is done, lay on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment for easy clean-up. Divide spinach evenly between the 6 pieces and place on top. Top each with half oz mozzarella, then slices of roasted pepper and bake until melted, about 6-8 minutes.
