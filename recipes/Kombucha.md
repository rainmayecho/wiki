Kombucha
========

First fermentation
------------------

### Ingredients

- 14 cups water
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 Tbsp black or green tea (jasmine or unflavored)
- 2 cups (470 mL) unflavored kombucha (either from a previous batch or unpasteurized, unflavored store bought kombucha
- 1 or 2 SCOBYs (1 per fermentation container being used)

### Directions

1. Bring water to a boil in a clean pot and dissolve sugar into it.
2. Add the tea to steep for 5 minutes.
3. Strain tea into fermentation container(s), and cool tea to room temperature (recommend using ice bath).
3. Add your SCOBY and 2 cups of kombucha.
4. Cover jar with cloth or paper filter, and secure with rubber band. Ferment for 6-10 days, or until tea is slightly sweet and slightly vinegary; ferment longer for less sweet kombucha. Kombucha will ferment faster in warmer environments.
6. Reserve 2 cups from this batch to use as starter kombucha for your next batch. The rest can move into the second fermentation.
