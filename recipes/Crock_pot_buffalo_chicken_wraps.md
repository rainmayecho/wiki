===============================

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions
----------

1. In a crock pot, combine chicken, onion, garlic and broth (enough to cover your chicken, use water if the can of broth isn't enough). Cover and cook on high 3-4 hours or low for 5-6. Don't overcook or it will dry out.
2. Remove the chicken from pot, reserve 1/2 cup broth and discard the rest. Shred the chicken with two forks, return to the slow cooker with the 1/2 cup broth and the hot sauce and blue cheese and set to on high for an additional 30 minutes. Makes 3 cups chicken.
