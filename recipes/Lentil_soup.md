Lentil soup
===========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
- 8 cloves garlic, minced, about 4 teaspoons
- 1 pound dry lentils, rinsed (about 2 1/2 cups)
- 3 teaspoons ground cumin
- 3 teaspoons ground coriander
- 8 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Juice of 1 1/2 lemons, strained (about 5 tablespoons)
- 2 teaspoons salt
- Plain nonfat yogurt, for garnish
- Italian parsley or cilantro, finely chopped, for garnish

Directions
----------

1. In a large saucepan over moderately low heat, slowly cook onion in 2 tablespoons oil. When onion is soft and translucent, add 3 cloves garlic and cook only until garlic begins to release its flavor. Add lentils and toss them with onions and garlic. Immediately add 2 teaspoons cumin and 2 teaspoons coriander. Stir until they are fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover the pan, reduce heat, and simmer until lentils are very tender, about 40 minutes.
3. Remove soup from heat, let it cool, and purée at least 2 cups in a food processor or blender. Return purée to soup. Heat soup until it is nearly at a simmer.
4. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan on low heat, warm 1 table-spoon oil and add the remaining 5 cloves minced garlic, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, and the cinnamon.
5. Add a ladle of soup to these spices as soon as they are fragrant, about 1 minute, then stir this mixture back into the soup with lemon juice and salt. Simmer soup for 15 to 30 minutes before serving, do not allow it to boil, or the flavors will weaken.
6. Serve each bowl with a dollop of yogurt, a sprinkling of parsley, and, if you wish, wedges of whole-wheat pita bread.
