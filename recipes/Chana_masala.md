Chana masala
============

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 medium onions, minced
- 2 clove garlic, minced
- 4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 fresh, hot green chili pepper, minced
- 2 tablespoon ground coriander
- 4 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (I used a quarter of this because my cayenne is extremely hot)
- 2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 4 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground
- 2 tablespoon amchoor powder (see note)
- 4 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoon garam masala
- 4 cups tomatoes, chopped small or 2 15-ounce can of whole tomatoes with their juices, chopped small
- 1 1/3 cup water
- 8 cups cooked chickpeas or 4 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 lemon (juiced) (see note; I used an extra lemon to swap for the amchoor powder)

Directions
----------

1. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion, garlic, ginger and pepper and saut√© over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn heat down to medium-low and add the coriander, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, cumin seeds, amchoor (if using it), paprika and garam masala. Cook onion mixture with spiced for a minute or two, then add the tomatoes and any accumulated juices, scraping up any bits that have stuck to the pan. Add the water and chickpeas. Simmer until reduced to a thicker gravy (15-30 minutes), then stir in salt and lemon juice.
2. Eat up or put a lid on it and reheat it when needed. Curries such as this reheat very well, later or or in the days that follow, should it last that long.
