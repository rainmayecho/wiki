Schnitzel
=========

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 boneless pork loin chops (about 5 to 6 ounces each)
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 4 cups plain dried bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 sprig thyme
- Lemon wedges

Directions
----------

1. Begin by placing each chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and gently pounding them out with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until they are an even 1/4-inch thick.
2. Put the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs and milk in another shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs in a third dish and again season with salt and pepper. \#Lightly dredge each piece of pork in flour, then in the egg and finally into the bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs onto the pork gently so they have a nice even coating.
3. Lay the breaded pork cutlets in a single layer on a plate lined with parchment and refrigerate, uncovered, for 10 to 12 minutes to allow the coating to dry out a little and adhere to the pork.
4. Heat oil and butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the thyme sprig and let it fry for about 1 minute to infuse the oil. Remove the thyme sprig and reserve. Gently lay the cutlets into the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and transfer to a serving platter while still hot. Garnish with lemon wedges and the fried thyme sprig before serving.
