Directions
----------

1. In a 10" skillet (w/lid) melt butter over medium heat; turn off heat.
2. Mix in sugar and brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and add 1/2 cup water, stirring to combine.
3. Bring mixture to a boil and allow to boil until beginning to thicken.
4. Reduce heat to medium; stir in apple slices, turning to coat.
5. Cook over medium to medium high heat 4-5 minutes, stirring, allowing sauce to continue to thicken.
6. Reduce heat to low, cover apples and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, another 5-10 minutes, adding more water if necessary, until apples are tender (cooking time will depend on the thickness of your apple slices).
7. Sauce will thicken as it cools.
