====================

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter
- 2 medium onions, finely chopped (2 cups)
- 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
- 3 tablespoons curry powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken, cut into 10 serving pieces
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes (consider replacing w/ tomatoes, or blending sauce to make smoother)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 3/4 cup cashews (1/4 pound)
- 3/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
- Accompaniment: cooked basmati or jasmine rice
- Garnish: chopped fresh cilantro

Directions
----------

1. Heat butter in a 5- to 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderately low heat until foam subsides, then cook onions, garlic, and ginger, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, salt, cumin, and cayenne and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add chicken and cook, stirring to coat, 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, including juice, and cilantro and bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes. (If making ahead, see cooks' note, below.)
2. Just before serving, pulse cashews in a food processor or electric coffee/spice grinder until very finely ground, then add to curry along with yogurt and simmer gently, uncovered, stirring, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.
