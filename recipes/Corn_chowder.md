    - 1 tablespoon olive oil
    - 1 tablespoon butter
    - 1 large onion, finely chopped
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced
    - 2 jalapeño peppers, finely chopped
    - 1 tablespoon chili powder
    - 3 tablespoons flour
    - 4 cups chicken stock
    - 2 15-ounce cans small red or black beans, drained and rinsed
    - 1 cup whole milk
    - Salt and pepper to taste
    - 1 cup heavy cream
- To finish
    - 1/4 cup mayonnaise
    - 1/4 cup sour cream or Mexican crema
    - 1/2 cup finely crumbled Cotija or feta cheese, plus more for serving
    - 1 lime
    - 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro
    - Chili powder or Tajín
    - Tortilla chips

Directions
----------

1. Partially blend corn with an immersion blender.
2. In a large (5 quarts is ideal) heavy pot, heat olive oil and butter over medium.
3. Add onion and cook until tender and beginning to brown at the edges, about 6 to 8 minutes.
4. Add garlic, jalapeño and chili powder and cook together for 2 minutes more.
5. Add flour and stir into onion-garlic mixture until it disappears.
6. Stirring constantly, gradually add stock.
7. Add beans, corn, and 1 cup milk and bring to a simmer.
8. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 13 minutes, until corn is tender.
9. Add salt (I used about 1 tablespoon Diamond kosher salt total here) and freshly ground black pepper or cayenne to taste.
10. Add cream to taste (we found 1/2 cup sufficient, but it will be less creamy than traditional) and cook for 3 minutes more.
11. To finish, Combine mayonnaise, sour cream or crema, cheese, and juice of half a lime in a bowl; stir to combine.
12. Ladle soup into bowls and dollop in center with 1 tablespoon (or more to taste) of mayo-cheese mixture.
13. Squeeze remaining lime juice over to taste, sprinkle with chili powder and chopped cilantro and serve, baked tortilla chips on the side if you wish.
