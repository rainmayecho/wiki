Tacos
=====

Ingredients
-----------

- 3-4 T Chili powder
- 1-2 T Cumin
- 2 limes, juiced
- 1lb chicken/pork/shrimp
- Veggie oil

Directions
----------

1. If cooking shrimp or pork (not shrimp) and you want it to be shredded rather than chunked, slow cook on low for 6 hours. Shred with a fork.
2. From here, all meats are cooked the same.
3. Heat up a pan with oil as hot as possible, and add the meat of your choice. Saute for 5-10 minutes. Shredded chicken breast will need quite a bit of oil to not taste dry, non-shredded and fattier meats and will require less.
4. Add a \*lot\* of chili powder, and about 1/2 that much cumin. I use probably 3-4 tablespoons of chili powder. Add this to taste; I prefer adding this over salt (chili powder has some salt in it). It isn't spicy at all, more just a rich earthy flavor.
5. Add lime juice, again to taste; I like about 2 limes per 1lb of meat.
