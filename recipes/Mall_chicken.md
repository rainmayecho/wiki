Mall chicken
============

Ingredients
-----------

- 1/3 C honey
- 1/4 C ketchup
- 3 T soy sauce
- 2 T apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar
- 2 T brown sugar
- 1 T minced garlic
- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, or a mix, cut into 1" pieces
- + kosher salt
- 1/4 C cornstarch
- 1 T oil
- 2 T sesame seeds, for topping
- + cooked white rice, for serving (optional)

Directions
----------

1. Heat the oven to 375Â°F.
2. Whisk the honey, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and garlic in a bowl until smooth.
3. Place the chicken in another bowl, season with a little salt, and dust with the cornstarch, tossing to coat and shaking off the excess.
4. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, sear the chicken, forming a light crust. Transfer the chicken to a baking dish.
5. Pour the sauce over the chicken and toss to coat. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling and thick, about 20 minutes. Scatter with sesame seeds.
