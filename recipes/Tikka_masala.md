Tikka masala
============

Ingredients
-----------

- 6 garlic cloves, finely grated
- 4 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger
- 1 Tbsp teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 Tbsp garam masala
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 cups whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
- 3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 3T tomato paste
- 2 dried chiles de Ã¡rbol or 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 14-ounce can diced tomatoes
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro plus sprigs for garnish
- Sugar, to taste
- Steamed basmati rice (for serving)

Directions
----------

1. Food process garlic and ginger, then combine with garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.
2. Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.
3. Add canned tomatoes to pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.
4. Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a pan with foil and place chicken-yogurt mix inside. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.
6. Blend sauce until smooth. Add back to pan.
7. Add chicken to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.
