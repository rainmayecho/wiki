Baked beans
===========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 pound dried Great Northern beans
- 1 pound bacon, chopped
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1-1/2 jalapenos, chopped and seeded
- 1/4 cup tomato paste (1 small can)
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar (add extra at end to finish)
- 1/4 cup molasses
- Vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt

Directions
----------

1. Heat oven to 250 degrees F.
2. Soak beans in a plastic container overnight in just enough cold water to submerge them completely (should be mostly dry by next day).
3. Place a cast iron Dutch oven over medium heat and stir in the bacon, onion, and jalapenos until enough fat has rendered from the bacon to soften the onions, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, dark brown sugar, and molasses.
4. Drain the beans and reserve the soaking liquid. Add the drained beans to the Dutch oven. Place the soaking liquid in a measuring cup and add enough vegetable broth to equal 4 cups of liquid. Add the liquid to the Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Add in black pepper and salt. Give them a stir and cover with the lid. Place the Dutch oven in the oven for 6 to 8 hours, or until the beans are tender. If slow cooking, cook on low for 8 hours, leaving uncovered for the last few hours.
