=======

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 ounces cheese (ripe Romadur 60% [Belgian soft cheese] or Brie)
- 4 ounces cheese (ripe Camembert [French soft cheese])
- 4 ounces butter (softened)
- 1/2 cup onion (finely minced, not chopped)
- 1 tablespoon paprika (sweet Hungarian)
- 1 teaspoon paprika (hot or spicy Hungarian, or to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon caraway (ground)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
- Fresh heavy cream to achieve desired consistency

Directions
----------

1. In a medium bowl, mash together the Romadur or Brie cheese, Camembert cheese and softened butter until well combined.
2. Add the minced onion, sweet Hungarian paprika, spicy Hungarian paprika, ground caraway, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix until thoroughly combined.
3. Add heavy cream to desired spreading consistency. The Obatzda spread should be the color of bricks.
4. Refrigerate for a few hours to let the tastes meld together.
5. If you like a smooth spread, combine the cheeses, butter, and spices in a food processor until smooth. Add the minced onion last, by hand.
6. Serve with more thinly sliced onions, pretzels, bread, and beer.
