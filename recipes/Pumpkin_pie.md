Pumpkin pie
===========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 3/4 cups pumpkin puree, from a 15-ounce (425 gram) can or homemade
- 2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) fine sea or table salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- A few gratings of fresh nutmeg (or a pinch of ground nutmeg)
- 1 1/3 cups (315 ml) cold heavy cream
- 3 large eggs
- Pie crust

Directions
----------

1. Heat oven to 400F
2. Combine pumpkin, sugar, salt and spices in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a sputtering simmer and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Scoop cooked pumpkin filling into bowl, and whisk in cold cream until smooth. Whisk in eggs, one at a time. Pour filling into prepared pie crust.
3. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F (175°C) and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, until only the center barely jiggles and a toothpick inserted into it comes out pumpkin-free. (Damp is fine, but the toothpick shouldn’t have loose pumpkin batter on it.)
