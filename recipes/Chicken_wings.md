Chicken wings
=============

Ingredients
-----------

- 20 to 25 chicken wings
- Vegetable oil for deep frying
- 1/4 c. butter
- 1/2 to 1 bottle (2 1/2 oz.) Louisiana hot sauce, or to taste
- Celery sticks
- Blue cheese dressing

Directions
----------

1. Cut wings in half. Remove wing tips. Deep-fry wings, about half at a time in hot oil until they are crisp and golden brown, about 10 minutes. (Do not use any batter or crumbs). Drain wings well.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan. Add about 1/2 of the bottle of hot sauce; stir until well blended. Using 1/2 bottle will give medium-hot chicken wings. If you like your wings hotter, add the whole bottle. If you want them milder add more butter. Place chicken wings in a large container with a cover, pour sauce over wings. Mix well.
3. Serve warm with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Dip the wings and celery sticks in dressing as you eat. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
