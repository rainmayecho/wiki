Pretzels
========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 tablespoon barley malt syrup or dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons lard or softened or melted and cooled unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 2 cups lukewarm water
- 6 cups (about 30 ounces) all-purpose or bread flour
- 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup baking soda
- 1 large egg (for baking soda methods only)
- Coarse sea salt or pretzel salt

Directions
----------

1. In a mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), stir together syrup or sugar, lard or butter, yeast, water and half the flour. Add kosher salt and remaining flour and stir just until mixture comes together in a shaggy mass. Turn out onto counter (or attach dough hook to mixer) and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until smooth and supple. Cut into 12 pieces and let rest 5 minutes before shaping. For pretzel knots, roll into thin rope between hands (~1/2")
2. Transfer formed pretzel knots onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper (for easiest removal), giving each room to grow. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes (no need to cover them, but I could not resist lightly covering them with plastic to protect from drafts), then in the fridge for 1 hour or overnight.
3. Heat oven to 425 degrees F.
4. For standard baking soda bath: Bring 1 quart of water to a boil. Add baking soda (and step back, it foams up quickly) and stir to dissolve. Remove from heat and poach pretzels for 1 minute on each side in solution. Use slotted spoon to transfer pretzels to baking sheet. Continue until all pretzels are poached.
5. Beat egg with a teaspoon of water and brush it over poached pretzels for improved glossiness. Sprinkle pretzels with coarse or pretzel salt and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, rotating tray once to get an even, dark color. Transfer to rack. Serve warm.
