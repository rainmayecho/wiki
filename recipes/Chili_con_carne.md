Directions
----------

### If using whole chilies

1. Remove the stems and seeds from all dried chiles. Tear each chile into small pieces.
2. Dry roast the chiles by placing them in a large stainless steel skillet with no oil. Toast over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, until they are fragrant but not smoking. 
3. Lower the heat and rehydrate the chiles by adding water â€“ just enough water to cover them. 
4. Bring to a simmer and cover. Then turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
5. Add the chiles and their soaking liquid to a high-powered blender. Blend on high speed for about one minute, until nice and smooth. This makes your amazing chili paste base.


### The rest

1. In 3-quart saucepan, cook beef, onion and garlic over medium-high heat about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown; drain.
2. Stir in remaining ingredients except beans. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in beans. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low; simmer uncovered about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until desired thickness.
