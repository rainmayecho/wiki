Directions
----------

1. Clean the spinach and remove the stem part from the leaf. (Tear off any thick stem part in the middle of the leaves too..) Chop the onion and tomatoes finely.In a pan,heat 1/2 tsp of ghee and fry the items in the To roast and powder table. Add every thing together except cumin seeds and roast. Add cumin seeds lastly as it gets fried in no time. Do not burn anything which will turn the gravy bitter. Keep a side.I powdered this using a hand mortar and pestle in to a fine powder.
2. In the same pan, add the washed palak leaves and fry till it reduces in volume. The water in the leaves is enough to make it shrink. If you need all few drops of oil while frying. I saut√©ed in two batches.Transfer to a plate and cool down.
3. Grind it with the green chilies.
4. Heat pan and add the oil and fry onions thoroughly till it turns golden brown. Add turmeric and coriander powder and give it a quick stir in low flame.
5. Add the tomatoes and little salt to make the tomatoes cook fast. Add the kassori methi now,crush them in between your palms.
6. When the tomatoes turn mushy,add the ground palak paste. Fry in low flame for 4-5 minutes till oil separates or till the raw smell disappears and the palak gets cooked well.
7. Meanwhile boil water and add the paneer and switch off the stove and keep covered till use. Drain the paneer and add it to the paalak gravy. Add milk and mix carefully and bring to boil.Add the powdered garam masala.Mix well.
8. Transfer to the serving bowl and serve with hot roti or naan.
