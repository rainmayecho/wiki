======


Ingredients
-----------

- Turkey
- Flour
- Milk
- Butter
- Oil
- Salt
- Pepper


Directions
----------

1. Apply [brine][Chicken_brine.md])
2. Add [stuffing](Turkey_stuffing.md)
3. Put 3T butter underneath breast skin
4. Oil, then salt and pepper outer skin
5. Cook turkey for 2 hours at 350F, and move stuffing to a separate dish (turkey has to overcook to cook stuffing otherwise)
6. Finish cooking turkey until breast is 155F and thigh is 160F (USDA recommends 165 for food safety, but this leads to dryness)
7. Remove turkey, strain drippings into a saucepan. Once settled, skim as much fat from top as possible. Mix 2T flour and 4T drippings to make slurry, and whisk well; add slurry to saucepan. Add water if too salty. Heat gravy until warm and thickened.
