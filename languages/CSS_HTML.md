CSS/HTML
========

CSS
---

- Shoot for reusable classes, don't combine structure with skin (basic looks), and don't overuse location-dependent styles (don't use descendent selectors that are at a high level in the DOM like `body.div.sidebar.div.a.h3`).
- Make sure to use CSS lint (or ideally SASS)

Grid
----

CSS grid seems amazing.
Give it a shot.
